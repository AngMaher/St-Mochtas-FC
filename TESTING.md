![error](/assets/images/error-github.png)

- These errors have been on my github from the start. I have ignored them, but have made sure it has never gone over 4 errors.
- As I worked on my project I have worked on the errors or warnings, any trailing white space or missing colon, or missing lines between functions was all delt with as I coded.
